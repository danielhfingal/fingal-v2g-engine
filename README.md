A quiet rebellion, written in Python.
While the world argues about the future of energy, this little engine simply gets on with it.
It turns every parked electric car and every Powerwall into a distributed, open, bidirectional battery for the commons.
No gatekeepers.
No subscription.
No cloud that can be switched off.
It listens to public price signals — Octopus Agile, Tibber Pulse, Nord Pool, GO, anyone who publishes an open API — then gently nudges electrons in the direction the planet needs them most:

When wind turbines spill energy and prices go negative, it silently fills every battery it can reach.
When the grid is on its knees at 6 pm on a cold February evening, it gives the power back — calmly, precisely, for free if that’s what the moment demands.
When the price is fair, it trades. Not for greed. For balance.

Heartbeat-based liveness.
orjson-perfect diffs.
Zero phantom kWh.
Same DNA as tesla-powerwall-fingal, because the universe deserves consistency.
It runs on a Raspberry Pi in a cupboard, on a VPS, on a laptop that’s only on at night.
It costs nothing to run and nothing to share.
This is not about making one person rich.
This is about proving — quietly, relentlessly — that the energy transition doesn’t need permission, corporations, or billion-dollar batteries.
It only needs people who leave the code running.
Open source. Forever.
MIT licensed.
No paywalls.
No telemetry.
No planned obsolescence.
The grid is healing, one parked car at a time.
You don’t have to watch.
Just leave it plugged in.
The engine never sleeps.
The future is already here — it’s just quietly charging in your driveway.
